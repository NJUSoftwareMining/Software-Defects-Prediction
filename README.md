# Software-Defects-Prediction
Software Defects Prediction Based on Machine Learning

A National Undergraduate Scientific Innovation Project

Advisor: Ming Li,Associate Professor,LAMDA Group.

Members：Ruiyi Zhang, Weiping Song, Han Zhang, Kun Tao.

* Applied machine learning techniques(e.g.ACoForest Algorithm) to predict software defects.
* Got raw data using Bugzilla and CVS and link the bug reports with modification reports.
* Used the bug data set can be used to build and assess models for defect prediction.
