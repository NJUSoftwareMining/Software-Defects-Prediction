# Software-Defects-Prediction
Software Defects Prediction Based on Machine Learning
A National Undergraduate Scientific Innovation Project
Advisor: Ming Li,Associate Professor,LAMDA Group.

Applied machine learning techniques(e.g.ACoForest Algorithm) to predict software defects.
Got raw data using Bugzilla and CVS and link the bug reports with modification reports.
Used the bug data set can be used to build and assess models for defect prediction.
